    "While we're talking about vectors and indexing, let's address a few tricks for dealing with summation ($\\Sigma$) and product ($\\Pi$) notation in equations. This will be handy for understanding the math shown in lecture and for completing the homeworks. \n",
    "\n",
    "First thing is to understand the structure of summation notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain language, you can read this as: \"Take the sum of all values from $x_1$ to $x_n$.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have the vector $x = \\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\\\x_3\\end{bmatrix}$, you can express the sum of all the elements in that vector as $\\sum_{i=1}^{3}x_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's the same as typing `sum(x)` in R. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might also see nested sums occasionally: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} x_{i,j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means taking the sum of $x_{i,j}$ values for each value of $i$, and then summing those sums. It's the same as typing `sum(colSums(x))` in R, where `x` is an $n$ by $m$ matrix (more on matrices later). \n",
    "\n",
    "Product notation is similar, except instead of using a $\\Sigma$ you're using a $\\Pi$, and you're now multiplying the elements together : \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\prod_{i=1}^{3}x_i = x_1 \\times x_2 \\times x_3$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Below I'll describe three tricks for working with summation notation that may be handy when you're doing the homework. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Trick 1: Pulling terms out of a sum\n",
    "The first trick that I'll cover is knowing when and how to pull terms out of a sum. If the expression inside of the sum includes terms that don't involve the variable being iterated over, i.e., terms that don't include $x_i$, you can take those out of the sum expression and just multiply them by the number of times they would've been added in. Here's an example, trying to simplify the expression of the function $g$ of vector $x$: \n",
    "\n",
    "> $g(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3}(3 - x_i)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "I can expand this using the [\"Foil\" method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOIL_method) : \n",
    "\n",
    "> $g(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3}(3 - x_i)(3 - x_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3}(9 - 6x_i + {x_i}^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "9 doesn't have an $x_i$ in it so I can just take that term out - however be careful! As the expression is written right now, 9 would be added *for every iteration of $x_i$*, so when I take it out of the expression I need to multiply it by the number of iterations. In this case, the number of iterations is 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> $g(x) = 27 + \\sum_{i=1}^{3}(- 6x_i + {x_i}^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ta-da! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Trick 2: Splitting up a sum\n",
    "Now we can actually simplify the expression above a bit further. Any terms that are separated by a $+$ or a $-$ can be split into separate sum terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "> $g(x) = 27 + \\sum_{i=1}^{3}- 6x_i + \\sum_{i=1}^{3}{x_i}^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense if you think about the commutative property of addition: if you're adding things together, it doesn't matter what order you add them in. $-6x_1 + x_{1}^2 - 6x_2 + x_{2}^2 - 6x_3 + x_{3}^2$ is the same as $ -6x_1-6x_2-6x_3  + x_{1}^2 + x_{2}^2 + x_{3}^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trick 3: Pulling coefficients out of a sum\n",
    "Lastly, since $-6(x_1 + x_2 + x_3)$ is the same as $-6x_1 - 6x_2 - 6x_3$, we can simplify the $\\sum_{i=1}^{3}- 6x_i$ by bringing the $-6$ outside: \n",
    "\n",
    "> $g(x) = 27 - 6\\sum_{i=1}^{3}x_i + \\sum_{i=1}^{3}{x_i}^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is easier to work with than what we had above. Ok, now that we're comfortable thinking about vectors, indices and sums... lets talk about matrices!"
