To download **the latest version of R (currently, 4.1.2)** on your computer, go to http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/ and get the correct one for your operating system (Mac, Windows, etc). If you run into problems, you can check out [this tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu) and [this FAQ page](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/faqs.html). If that doesn't help, you can email one of the instructors. \n",
