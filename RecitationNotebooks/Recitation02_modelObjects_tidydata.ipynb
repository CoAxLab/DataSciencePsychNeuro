    "## 1. Data processing in R\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing data comes in many forms. Statistical analysis is only one stage of any data science workflow, and it assumes that you have cleaned, preprocessed and organized your data beforehand. Usually the raw data we receive as an output of an experimental software, from other scientists or the web, is messy, has unnecessary information, missing values, lacks explicit information you need, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "For many people, their first instinct is to open the data with Excel and to manually clean-up the data, by replacing values, creating new columns, etc., entirely by hand. The problem with that approach is that you cannot easily replicate the steps you have taken to transform the raw data into the final format you use for your analyses. This issue has many consequences, but among the two most common are, first, that if you get new or additional data from the same source, you would have to manually perform the same operations again, and second, if you make a mistake it would be difficult to identify where exactly that happened. The best approach is to preprocess your data with a script in the same way you do your analyses. However, doing so in base R can be quite cumbersome. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use tools for the **`tidyverse`** packages. Tidyverse is a collection of useful packages, which include ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, etc, combined in a single package.\n",

    "Here's where the pipe becomes useful. Let's say you want to calculate the summarise we described above separately for males and females. I will show you later how to do it more efficiently, but for the moment we can illustrate how you can chain commands with pipes. Rather than creating the intermediate **males** and **females** dataframes, we can chain the summarise function after the filter function. In the example below, we pass dat as the first argument of filter, then specify to keep only males, and then the resulting data.frame is passed on as the first argument to summarise:"
