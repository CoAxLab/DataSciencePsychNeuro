cardiovascular endurance by recording the distance that the participant is able to walk on a 50-foot (out and back) course in 2 minutes.  The participant's raw score is the distance in feet and inches walked in 2 minutes. Unadjusted Scale Score: Participant raw score is normed to those in the entire NIH Toolbox Normative Sample (18 and older), regardless of age or any other variable, where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average. "NIH Toolbox 2-minute Walk Endurance Test : Age-Adjusted Scale Score,Motor,Endurance (2 minute walk test),Endurance_AgeAdj,"This test measures sub-maximal cardiovascular endurance by recording the distance that the participant is able to walk on a 50-foot (out and back) course in 2 minutes.  The participant's raw score is the distance in feet and inches walked in 2 minutes. Age-adjusted Scale Score: Participant raw score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band."NIH Toolbox 4-Meter Walk Gait Speed Test: Computed Score,Motor,Locomotion (4-meter walk test),GaitSpeed_Comp,"Participants are asked to walk a short distance (4 meters) at their usual pace. Raw scores are recorded as the time in seconds required to walk 4 meters on each of the two trials, with the better trial used for scoring (raw scores are available on request to info@humanconnectome.org). Computed scores are in meters per second. On the 4-Meter Walk Gait Speed Test, higher computed scores are indicative of better gait speed (i.e., fewer seconds to walk four meters). "NIH Toolbox 9-hole Pegboard Dexterity Test : Unadjusted Scale Score,Motor,Dexterity (9-hole Pegboard),Dexterity_Unadj,"This test of manual dexterity records the time required for the participant to accurately place and remove 9 plastic pegs into a plastic pegboard. Unadjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed to those in the entire NIH Toolbox Normative Sample (18 and older), regardless of age or any other variable, where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average. Higher scoring is indicative of better dexterity in the dominant hand. For the 9-Hole Pegboard Dexterity Test, the raw score, recorded as time in seconds that it takes the participant to complete the task, is commonly used for interpretation, with faster completion times (less time to complete) representing better manual dexterity. This also allows for raw comparisons between dominant and non-dominant hand performance. Raw scores are available on request to info@humanconnectome.org. However, one can also evaluate performance with the dominant hand by looking at the normative scale scores provided here."NIH Toolbox 9-hole Pegboard Dexterity Test : Age-Adjusted Scale Score,Motor,Dexterity (9-hole Pegboard),Dexterity_AgeAdj,"This test of manual dexterity records the time required for the participant to accurately place and remove 9 plastic pegs into a plastic pegboard. Age-adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band. Higher scoring is indicative of better dexterity in the dominant hand. For the 9-Hole Pegboard Dexterity Test, the raw score, recorded as time in seconds that it takes the participant to complete the task, is commonly used for interpretation, with faster completion times (less time to complete) representing better manual dexterity.

Computed Score,Sensory,Audition (Words in Noise),Noise_Comp,"This test measures a persons ability to recognize single words presented amid varying levels of background noise. It measures how much difficulty a person might have hearing in a noisy environment. A percent correct is calculated, which is then translated into a threshold score for each ear, in decibels of signal-to-noise ratio (dB S/N), using a look-up table. The range of possible scores for each ear is -2.0 to 26.0 dB S/N, with lower scores indicative of better performance and, conversely, higher scores potentially suggestive of hearing difficulties. Note: HCP has used two versions of the NIH Toolbox WIN test (V1 and V2). In V1 the audio output was through a sound card and equalizer that is no longer supported and in V2 the audio output goes straight through the headphone jack worn by the participant. HCP switched from V1 to V2 WIN on January 23, 2015, so all Q1-S500 Subjects were administered V1 and most S900+ Subjects were administered V2."NIH Toolbox Odor Identification Age 3+ Unadjusted Scale Score,Sensory,Olfaction (Odor Identification Test),Odor_Unadj,"This task assesses a persons ability to identify various odors. Using 9 scratch-and-sniff cards, participants are asked to identify which of four pictures matches the odor they have just smelled. Raw scores are calculated by simply summing the total number of correct items (0 to 9). Higher scores indicate better olfactory ability/functioning. Unadjusted Scale Score: Participant raw score is normed to those in the entire NIH Toolbox Normative Sample (18 and older), regardless of age or any other variable, where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average.

Raw scores are calculated by simply summing the total number of correct items (0 to 9). Higher scores indicate better olfactory ability/functioning. Age-adjusted Scale Score: Participant raw score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band."NIH Toolbox Pain Intensity Survey Age 18+: Raw score,Sensory,Pain (Pain Intensity and Interference Surveys),PainIntens_RawScore,"This measure consists of a single item measuring immediate (i.e., acute) pain in adults. It asks a participant to rate level of pain experienced over the last seven days on a 0-10 scale, with 0 representing no pain, and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain. No derived scores are available. One could reasonably expect a large proportion of the normal population to obtain scores ofzero on this measure. Regardless, it is an easily quantifiable piece of information on ones subjective pain experience. "NIH Toolbox Pain Interference Survey Age 18+: T-score,Sensory,Pain (Pain Intensity and Interference Surveys),PainInterf_Tscore,"The pain interference survey measures, in CAT format, the self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of ones life. This includes the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical and recreational activities. Higher theta (mean = 50, SD = 10) and T-Scores represent greater participant report of pain interference in daily life. "NIH Toolbox Regional Taste Intensity Age 12+ Unadjusted Scale Score,Sensory,Taste (Taste Intensity Test),Taste_Unadj,"This test measures the perceived intensity of quinine (a bitter tastant) and salt administered in liquid solutions swished around in the whole mouth or applied to the tip of the tongue. Participants rate the taste on a generalized labeled magnitude scale (gLMS) of perceived intensity, with seven anchor labels provided (Strongest imaginable, Very strong, Strong, Moderate, Weak, Barely detectable, No sensation) on a 0-100 scale, which is then converted to a normative scale. Whole mouth quinine normative scale scores are provided where higher performance is indicative of higher perceived taste intensity.  Unadjusted Scale Score: Participant raw score is normed to those in the entire NIH Toolbox Normative Sample (18 and older), regardless of age or any other variable, where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average.
