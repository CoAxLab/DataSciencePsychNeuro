    "\n",
    "* **Improved use of theory and stronger research methods due to the initial review.** Because researchers are forced to formulate a proposal for a new study without seeing results first, there is an expectation that they will do a better job of addressing research motivation and design. The result should be better studies that respond clearly to precisely formulated questions.\n",

    "* **A decline in false-positive publications.** If publication decisions are based on outcome-neutral criteria — which are largely addressed before conducting the study — then researchers will not be motivated to engage in practices that increase the likelihood of making a type I error. Results from studies that utilize such practices, separate from a pre-registered analytic plan, would be publishable strictly as exploratory research.\n",

    "* **Pre-registration could lead to undervaluing exploratory research.**  If pre-registered studies have greater merit because they are less susceptible to publication bias via such practices as p-hacking and HARKing, then studies using exploratory analyses may not be held in the esteem they presently enjoy. This could lead to a decline in funding for such projects, and the discoveries that such research can yield.\n",
