    "\n",
    "The categories in Haslett's visual vocabulary covers nine types of patterns or relationships that you may be trying to get across.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "### Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Emphasizes variations (+/-) from a fixed reference point. Typically the reference point is zero but it can also be a target or a long-term average. Can also be used to show sentiment (positive/neutral/negative). For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "![Deviation](imgs/L4DeviationPlot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "You can see how presenting deviation information is more nuanced than presenting mean values because the relative variation around a baseline collapses information from two dimensions into one (i.e., a subtraction of two values to make one difference score). Thus you can convey more information as relative differences. But this type of approach often neglects or overlooks things like natural base rates.\n",

    "\n",
    "![Correlation](imgs/L4CorrelationPlot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistically, a correlation means that two or more variables covary together: as one changes, the other changes too. So plots designed to illustrate correlative relationships have to get across this mutual dependency in the data. Typically this is done with a simple scatter plot, but as the example above shows, you can often convey multiple information dimensions in a single correlation plot.\n",

Choosing the correct time period is important to provide suitable context for the reader.

For example, consider a recent illustration of \"bubble\" dynamics for investment plotted against Bitcoin value.\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## 1. Don't force ideas into text if they can be conveyed visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to using good visualizations is to reduce the need to use written prose when a visual image will get across the same information easier. This is often helpful when describing your methods. Consider this figure of a behavioral task.\n",

    "\n",
    "The top panel (A) shows a task where participants are supposed to stop a rising bar when it intersects with a target line at 520ms. Participants get points for being as close to the target line as possible. On some trials the bar stops and turns red (a stop signal), indicating that participants shouldn't press a button to stop the bar anymore. The bottom panel (B) shows the different groups, where the stop signal is sampled from one of 3 probability distributions (Uniform, Early, & Late). Probe stop signals are also included for all subjects at 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400ms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the dynamics of the task shown in the figure are augmenting how I describe the task in the text. Hopefully the trial dynamics and the critical differences betweeen the groups are clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## 2. Cluttered figures discourage the reader from trying to understand your argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a good figure can make your story easier to tell, a bad figure can completely ruin your narrative. If you put too much in your figure (e.g., too many panels, high density of visual information per figure, too much text), then your reader spends more time examining the figure than they are reading the text. Remember _graphics are supposed to make the reader's job easier, not harder_.\n",

    "Little known fact that there is an 8th deadly sin: not accurately showing your variance on a bar plot.\n",

    "The left panel shows your standard bar plot of the means with standard error acorss conditions. But standard error (along with standard deviation and variance) _assume_ that you have symmetrical distributions around the mean. This is almost always not correct. You can see this in the middle panel, which shows the mean and standard error as black dots and error bars respectively, but this figure also plots each individual data point in each group. So you can see the spread of the data and clearly see the whole variability in each group. Another way to show this (if you have a lot of data and showing individual data points is tricky, is to use violin plots (right panel) that show the estimated kernel desnity of the distribution of the data instead. \n",
