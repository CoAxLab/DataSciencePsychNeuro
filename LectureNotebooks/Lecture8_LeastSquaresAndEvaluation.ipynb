    "Remember, as long as the assumptions listed above are not violated, you can use the equations shown above to find the best fitting regression coefficients (or more accurately, the best fitting line that describes $Y=f(X)$). To understand why you need to understand the concept of a [_likelihood function_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Likelihood function**: The probability that the data you observed arises from a probability distribution defined by a specific set of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, it is the likelihood of the data ($Y$) given the specific predictor variables ($X$) and a mapping fuction ($f()$), including the parameters that describe the distribution of the data. \n",

    "Now that last part of the description of the likelihood is the important part. This is why we have the first assumption that $Y$ is normally distributed. Remember from our first lab that the probability distribution function for a normal distribution is\n",

In other words, $ RSS = (y_1 - \\hat{b}_0 - \\hat{b}_1x_1) + ... + (y_n - \\hat{b}_0 - \\hat{b}_1x_n) $ is normally distributed. Thus we can assume that the likelihood is the product ($\\prod$) of all the residual errors, which  are random variables from a normal distribution. Let's consider this in the case where p = 1.\n",

    "## Coefficient of Determination ($r^2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the RSE, that measures error in your model, the $r^2$ statistic measures the percentage of variance in $Y$ that is explained by $X$. For this we compare a measure of the residuals from the model (RSS) to a measure of variance of $Y$ (TSS). \n",

    "\n",
    "Notice how the F-statistic is a hybrid of the RSE and $r^2$. It is an omnibus measure of the divergence of RSS & TSS. However, rather than be reflected as a strict ratio that is constrained between 0 & 1 (like $r^2$), the F-statistic can be any positive number since it is using RSS as the denominator, rather than TSS. Thus, what the F-statistic is telling you is whether the variance not explained by your model (TSS) is greater than the variance explained your model (RSS), if so then the ratio is high.\n",
