        "In this homework, we're going to simulate the relationship between age, word reading experience, and reading comprehension skill. Older children tend to be better at reading comprehension tasks, but this isn't just an inherent part of getting older. It's a combination of gaining more experience with reading, oral language skills, and executive functions development. In this homework, though, we're going to simplify this relationship down to a direct effect of age on reading comprehension (since improvements in oral language skills and executive functions are more guaranteed as children age than reading practice is), and a mediation of word reading experience.\n",
